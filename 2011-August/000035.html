<PRE>
Seeing that ledmac/ledpar has a new maintainer, who has quickly found the time to fix an irritating bug (thanks for that, Ma&#239;eul!) I see my chance to propose some fixes, improvements and additions.

The reason why I don't add them directly to github is that I am hoping for some input from you other users on these proposals: 
	Do you agree that these would be good additions? 
	Which ones would you prioritise? (below my own tentative ranking)
	Do you have any good workarounds for the problems I describe?


Thanks for reading/thinking about/commenting!
All the best,
Florian.


A: BUGS (?):

1) Large apparatuses (more than halv the page) makes ledpar go out of sync after some pages.
2) when enlarging the page with a flexible length e.g.
\addtolength{\skip\Afootins}{-2.5mm} 
but only using the footnoteseries A on *one* side of ledpar, the syncing gets messed up.
When I use a fixed length instead, e.g.
\setlength{\skip\Afootins}{5mm}
the behaviour seems to be ok.


B: SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS:

1) BETTER PAGEBREAK CONTOL: 
In the main text I can use \pagebreak in between paragraphs (\pend\pagebreak\pstart) in ledmac, but it is ignored inside a paragraph and completely ignored everywhere in ledpar. I'd really like \pagebreak to work like in standard LaTeX.
Footnotes are never broken over page-breaks. Usually this is a good practice, but sometimes, when they get very long (e.g. when one ms adds or replaces a whole paragraph or even chapter) one needs to split them over several pages. Also here a sort of specialised \pagebreak-command would come in very handy.
(Can be worked around manually, but VERY cumbersome.)

2) WIDOW/ORPHAN CONTROL in ledpar. Without 1) it even doing this manually is very difficult.

3) SECTIONING COMMANDS (\chapter/\section&#8230;) as part of the numbered text. 
This applies mainly when editing texts that already have sectioning, that I need to reproduce and possibly add critical remarks to. 
Ideally ledmac would have two series of sectioning-commands: The usual ones, that *automatically* stop line-numbering, and a second one, \edchapter, \edsection, &#8230; that have the same formatting as the usual ones, write to leftmark/rightmark, add TOC-entries, *but* are part of the numbered text.
(Can be worked around manually, but cumbersome.)

4) \LEDSIDENOTES WORKING EVERYWHERE, also in (i.e. beside) the apparatus. Cf. e.g. the marginnotes-package.

5) allow LINE BREAKS AND INDENTS IN THE APPARATUS.

6) \ledsidenotes shouldn't just be deleted when the next ledsidenote happens to be in the same row &#8211; there should either be a warning and/or automatic pushing them to the next line, preferably both.

7) draft-mode: I know, it can be changed easily, but italicising is IMO an unfortunate default, as it is used in a number of other contexts (many critical texts use it for abbreviations) and it changes spacing; underlining works reasonably well.




C: THINGS I'D LOVE TO SEE SOMETIMES IN THE FUTURE:

1) more than two text-streams for editions with more than two main text versions.

2) possibility to put the apparatus completely on one side, the text on the other (cf. newer vols. of Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum)
